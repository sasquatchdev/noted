Inspired by [Notion](https://notion.so), Noted aims to provide
a customizable yet intuitive note-taking experience. However,
in my opinion, Notion is quite lacking when it comes to even
quite basic automation.

I've been using Notion for school for a while now, but always
found the limitations fairly annoying.
Therefore, with Noted, I aim to create a more customizable and
automatable experience including self-hosting, an advanced API
and more.

## Usage

To get started with using the hosted variant, just head out to
[the Noted homepage](https://noted.sasquatchdev.me) and create
an account.

### Self-hosting
If you want to self-host, you can find an in-depth guide in the
wiki section of the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/sasquatchdev/noted).
